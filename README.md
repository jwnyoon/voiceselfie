<h1>Voice Selfie</h1>


<h3>Voice visualization platform for mobile phone</h3>

CALL 253.397.2170 AND TELL ME WHO YOU ARE


This project is the final project of Redial : interactive telephony at ITP, NYU 2014.
A voice contains different information from text itself. We can guess the feeling, status, mood from voice. As we have different faces, we all have different voices. 

Voice selfie allows users to take selfies without camera. It only relies on the basic function of telephone which is making a phone call. Asterisk gets user's voice information and python generates the image based on the voice components. Users will receive the image via MMS. This project is the final project of Redial : Interactive Telephony class at ITP NYU 2014.

I did not use amplitude of voice to create images because users did't really speak loud and when they explained about themselves via phones.Below are some sample images that I got.
